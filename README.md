## Installation

Clone the respository, run **_npm i_** to install dependencies (inquirer).

## Usage

**NOTE: By default this application will build and populate an array with an index of 50.000.000. This will cause the app to take longer than expected time to start.**

Once started, select the search method you wish to use to iterate though the array in search of a number, and then enter the number you wish to search for.
